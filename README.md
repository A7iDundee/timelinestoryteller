[Timeline Storyteller](https://timelinestoryteller.com/) is an expressive browser-based visual storytelling environment for presenting timelines.

You can use Timeline Storyteller to present different aspects of your data using a palette of timeline representations, scales, and layouts, as well as controls for filtering, highlighting, and annotation. You can export images of a timeline or assemble and record a story about your data and present it within the application.

To learn more about the research that informed this project, see [timelinesrevisited.github.io](https://timelinesrevisited.github.io/), which includes a survey of timeline tools and more than 200 bespoke timelines.

See [these examples](https://timelinestoryteller.com/#examples) of timelines and timeline stories made with Timeline Storyteller.

## Project Team

## Setup / Testing

1. Clone the main branch of this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/timelinestoryteller.git`

2. Ensure that [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) are installed.

3. Open a terminal at the root of the repository and run `npm install`.

4. Test and package the Timeline Storyteller component: `npm test`

5. Start the node server: `npm start`
 > Optionally, run with `NODE_ENV=production npm start` which will run the server in production mode.

6. Open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/)

* The Timeline Storyteller component source code can be found in the [src](/src) directory.
* The images & css for the component can be found in the [assets](/assets) directory.
* The website can be found in the [public](/public) directory.

## Preparing your data

Timeline Storyteller currently supports datasets of events in CSV, JSON, or Google Spreadsheet format.

Each event is specified by the following attributes:

- __Required__: `start_date`, date: YYYY, YYYY-MM-DD, or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MMZ formats are supported (Z necessary for specifying UTC, otherwise HH:MM will be time-zone dependent). BC dates are permitted, e.g., -27, -13800000000
- __Optional__: `end_date`, date: using same format as `start_date`
- __Optional__: `category`, a string corresponding to the category of the event (which Timeline Storyteller encodes as colour)
- __Optional__: `facet`,a string corresponding to another category of the event (which Timeline Storyteller uses to create a faceted timeline layout; `category` and `facet` can be identical if desired)
- __Optional__: `content_text`, a string description of the event (which Timeline Storyteller exposes as event annotations)

### Example event in JSON:

`{
  "start_date":"1775",
  "end_date":"1783",
  "content_text":"American Revolutionary War: an armed struggle for secession from the British Empire by the Thirteen Colonies that would subsequently become the United States.",
  "facet":"North America",
  "category":"North America"
},`

### Example event in CSV:

header row:

`start_date,end_date,content_text,facet,category`

example event row:

`1775,1783,American Revolutionary War: an armed struggle for secession from the British Empire by the Thirteen Colonies that would subsequently become the United States.,North America,North America`

### Example CSV / Google Spreadsheet

Here is the [The Daily Routines of Famous Creative People](https://podio.com/site/creative-routines) demo dataset used in Timeline Storyteller's demo in a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x8N7Z9RUrA9Jmc38Rvw1VkHslp8rgV2Ws3h_5iM-I8M/pubhtml).

- Ensure that the spreadsheet is published (open the Google Spreadsheet 'File' menu, select 'Publish to the Web').
- Ensure that `start_date` and `end_date` columns are formatted as text and not as dates (e.g., `'1926-06-29`).
- __Required__: Spreadsheet URL
- __Optional__: Worksheet title (i.e., tab name) for this dataset: `dailyroutines`
- Enter the spreadsheet URL and worksheet title into Timeline Storyteller's load dialog.

## Component Usage

Add the following to your `index.html` page:

```
<! -- Runtime css -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/intro.js/2.3.0/introjs.min.css" charset="UTF-8">

<!-- Runtime Dependencies -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/3.5.17/d3.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.18.1/moment.min.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/intro.js/2.3.0/intro.min.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/1.7.2/socket.io.min.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
```

Then you can use Timeline Storyteller in a couple of ways:

### Traditional

```
<!-- Timeline Storyteller -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="dist/timelinestoryteller.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<script>
  new TimelineStoryteller(false); // Create a new Timeline Storyteller instance
</script>
```

### Webpack

- Configure your `webpack.config.js` to add a few configuration settings:
```
module.exports = {

    // These rules are necessary to bundle correctly
    rules: [{
        test: /\.css$/,
        loaders: ["style-loader", "css-loader"]
    }, {
        test: /\.(png|svg)$/,
        loader: "binary-loader"
    }]

    // Optional if you have the cdn versions of these libraries from above in your index.html, otherwise these dependencies
    // can be removed from your externals section.
    externals: {
        d3: "d3",
        moment: "moment",
        "intro.js": "{ introJs: introJs }",
    },
    plugins: [
        new webpack.IgnorePlugin(/socket.io/) // Ignores the socket.io dependency as this is only necessary for the timelinestoryteller.com website.
    ]
};
```
- If you are bundling the dependencies with your application bundle, then include the following in your entry file:
```
require("intro.js/introjs.css"); // Loads the intro.js css
```

- Instantiate the Timeline Storyteller
```
var TimelineStoryteller = require("timeline_storyteller");
var instance = new TimelineStoryteller(true);
```

## Application Usage

Note that more detailed usage instructions are available at [timelinestoryteller.com](https://timelinestoryteller.com/)

1. Load timeline data (demo dataset, JSON, CSV, Google Spreadsheet) or saved timeline story (a JSON Blob with extension .cdc; see step 6)

2. Select a combination of representation, scale, and layout from the menu at the top of the screen; only some combinations are valid; see [our guidance on selecting appropriate combinations for your story](http://timelinesrevisited.github.io/supplemental/gallery/). Mouseover these options to view a tooltip that describes how they might be useful.

3. Edit the canvas

	* Click on events to annotate with their `content_text` label; resize and reposition labels; SHIFT + click to highlight events without showing label.

	* Annotate with captions and images; resize and reposition captions and images.

 	* Filter events by category, facet, or segment. Filter by highlighting emphasizing matching events (de-emphasizing non-matching events).

	* You can also filter by hiding non-matching events.

4. Record current canvas as a scene, which retains labels, captions, and images. Enter playback mode, navigate to previous / next recorded scene.

5. Export current canvas as a PNG, SVG.

6. Export the scenes as an animated GIF or as a JSON Blob (.cdc extension).
